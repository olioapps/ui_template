# Olio Skeleton

## React - Redux

Steps to get started: 
`npm install`

`npm run preflight` to make sure everything is running correctly

`npm run web` to start web server. Open http://localhost/3000 in a web browser.

# Olio Naming Conventions

## File name conventions

All file names will be snake cased, for example:

`my_page.html`
`blue_component.jsx`

## JSON conventions

We will use camel case keys and values, for example:

`
  {
      "myKey": "myValue"
  }
`
## GitHub repo naming convention

We will use kebab case for github repos:

`
   olioapps-repo
`

## Quotes policy

Unless there is no choice, double quotes for strings.

## URL Path Conventions

We will use kebab case for url paths
`
   /olioapps-path
`
